%% Function generates 3x2 windows for each of the light condition in seconds based on standard Hydra bluelight stimulation conditions.

function [prelight, bluelight, postlight] = getBluelightFeatWindows(bluelightInterval,windowDuration)

%% INPUTS: 
% bluelightInterval: [60,70; 160,170; 260,270] (default). nx2 matrix, each row specifying the
% start and end time (in seconds) of the bluelight stimulation window. 
% windowDuration: 10 (default). scalar specifying the time window to retain for feature
% analysis.

%% OUTPUTS:
% prelight: nx2 matrix, each row representing the start and end time (in
% seconds) of the 10 seconds preceding each bluelight interval.
% bluelight: nx2 matrix, each row representing the start and end time (in
% seconds) of the 10 seconds flanking each end of the bluelight interval.
% postlight: nx2 matrix, each row representing the start and end time (in
% seconds) of the 10 seconds immediately following the bluelight windows.
